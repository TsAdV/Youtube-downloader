# Youtube-downloader
I am trying to make a basic application of downloading videos but there will be 3 gifs and I want each one to play for specific actions. I am a beginner in python I got to know it can not operate two operations whereas gifs can't also be played without constant updating. 
Suppose gif 1 needs to played untill the link is being provided and when the convert button is pressed gif 2 needs to be played constantly while the application is dowinloading the video in the bg, when the download is complete gif 3 needs to be played.
